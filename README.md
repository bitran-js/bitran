# Bitran

Bitran (**B**lock & **I**nliner **tran**spiler) is a highly customizable text processor and transpiler for converting any structured text into programming-friendly DOM (document object model) that consists of elements: blocks and inliners. These elements can be easily analyzed or rendered into any other format: HTML, Vue, etc...

ðŸš§ **Bitran is under heavy development!**

**Key features:**

- User defined blocks and inliners
- YAML structured blocks structure support
- Infinite nesting of blocks and inliners
- Flexible meta syntax with YAML support
- Handy DOM representation of text
- Built-in ID assignment and error handling

## Monorepo Structure

- `packages/core` â€” Bitran types, schemas and DOM
- `packages/transpiler` â€” text â†’ (**parse**) â†’ DOM â†’ (**stringify**) â†’ text
- `packages/renderer-vue` â€” rendering DOM with Vue framework
